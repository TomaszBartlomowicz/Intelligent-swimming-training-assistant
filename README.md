# Intelligent Swimming Training Assistant

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a **wearable system** designed to enhance swimming training. The system provides **real-time monitoring** of a swimmer's physiological parameters and guides them through a structured training regimen.

The system is composed of two main components:

### 1. Measurement Unit
A wearable device based on the **ESP32-C3** microcontroller, designed to be attached to swimming goggles or worn as a wristband. It continuously monitors:

- Heart Rate (HR)  
- Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂)  

### 2. Companion Application
A specialized application hosted on a **Raspberry Pi**, responsible for:

- Receiving data wirelessly from the measurement unit  
- Analyzing training progress  
- Logging session data  
- Delivering real-time feedback to the user  

### 🏊 App Features
- **Training Planning** – schedule personalized swimming sessions  
- **Guided Training** – follow workouts with real-time monitoring and feedback  
- **Historical Data Review** – analyze past training sessions and track progress  
- **Maximum Heart Rate Calculator** – determine HRmax to optimize training zones
