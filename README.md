## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a wearable system designed to enhance swimming training. This system will provide **real-time monitoring** of a swimmer's physiological parameters while guiding them through a pre-programmed training regimen.

The system is comprised of two primary components:

1.  **Measurement Unit**: A wearable device, based on an **ESP32-C3** microcontroller, designed to be affixed to swimming goggles or worn as a wristband. It features a sensor for continuous monitoring of:
    * Heart Rate
    * Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpOâ‚‚)

2.  **Companion Application**: A specialized application hosted on a **Raspberry Pi**. Its responsibilities include:
    * Receiving data wirelessly from the measurement unit.
    * Analyzing training progress.
    * Logging session data.
    * Delivering real-time feedback to the user.
